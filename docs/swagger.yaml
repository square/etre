          Groups metrics are measurements related to user-defined groups and entity types.
          The auth plugin sets groups for each caller (HTTP request). Metrics for the caller
          are added to each group in the list, so a single call can count toward one or more
          metric groups. If no groups are specified, no group metrics are recorded.
